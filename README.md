# Pharmaceutical Sales Analysis (Excel)
This project analyzes **synthetic pharmaceutical sales data** using **Microsoft Excel**. The dataset includes two tables: one for transaction details and another for company information. The goal is to demonstrate data analysis, pivot table creation, and dashboard visualization skills using Excel.

## Features

- **Synthetic Dataset**: Randomly generated data using an AI tool to simulate real-world pharmaceutical sales.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze sales data from two tables:
  - **Table 1**: Transaction details (Transaction No, Company ID, Call Duration, Sales Representative, Transaction Date, Purchase Amount, Feedback Score).
  - **Table 2**: Company details (Company ID, City, Company Name, Contact Number).
- **Pivot Tables**: Create pivot tables to summarize key metrics.
- **Dashboards**: Visualize insights such as:
  - **Total Purchase Amount**: Total sales by company or representative.
  - **Feedback Distribution**: Feedback scores across representatives and companies.
- **Excel Features Used**: Pivot Tables, Charts, Formulas, and Conditional Formatting.

## Dataset Details

The dataset used in this project is **synthetic** and was generated using an AI tool. It includes the following tables:

### Table 1: Transaction Details
| Transaction No | Company ID | Call Duration (minutes) | Sales Representative | Transaction Date | Purchase Amount ($) | Feedback Score |
### Table 2: Company Details
| Company ID | City       | Company Name       | Contact Number  |

## Steps to Analyze Data in Excel

1. **Load the Data**:
   - Open Excel and import the two datasets (`transactions.csv` and `companies.csv`).

2. **Merge the Data**:
   - Use the `VLOOKUP` or `XLOOKUP` function to combine the two tables based on `Company ID`.

3. **Create Pivot Tables**:
   - Summarize key metrics such as:
     - Total purchase amount by company and sales representative.
     - Average feedback score by representative and city.

4. **Build Dashboards**:
   - Use Excel charts (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps) to visualize:
     - **Total Purchase Amount**: Total sales by company or representative.
     - **Feedback Distribution**: Feedback scores across representatives and companies.

5. **Add Interactivity**:
   - Use slicers and filters to make the dashboard interactive.
